This C++ program by AYUSH DUTTA implements a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. The key features of the game are as follows:
(NOTE- ENTER -1 TO EXIT THE GAME WHENEVER U FEEL LIKE NOT PLAYING)
Key Features:
Game Board:
A 3x3 grid representing the game board is created using a 2D array.
Players:
Two players are assigned symbols 'X' and 'O'.
Players alternate turns to make their moves.
Display Board:
The current state of the game board is displayed after each move.
Player Input:
Players are prompted to enter their move by specifying row and column numbers (1 to 3).
Players can also enter -1 at any point to exit the game.
Input Validation:
The program checks for valid moves, ensuring the entered row and column are within the range and that the chosen cell is empty.
Invalid inputs are handled gracefully, prompting the player to try again.
Update Board:
The game board is updated with the current player's symbol after a valid move.
Win and Draw Checks:
After each move, the game checks if the current player has won by forming a line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The game also checks for a draw if all cells are filled without any player winning.
Switch Players:
The players alternate turns, switching from 'X' to 'O' or from 'O' to 'X'.
Display Result:
The game announces the result: either the winning player or a draw.
Play Again Option:
After a game ends, players are asked if they want to play another game.
The game resets if players choose to continue, or exits if they choose not to.
Exit Option:
Players can enter -1 at any time during their turn to exit the game immediately.
